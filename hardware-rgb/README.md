ergoSHIFT rev RGB
========================================================================

This is a RGB rev of the ergoSHIFT.  In this version, RGB LEDs were added to each Kailh button and can be assembled onto the board by JLCPCB (or another fab house), similar to the other SMT parts.

The firmware from the Rev2 folder works for this along with enabling the RGB LED via the GP2040-CE Web Configurator

All other assembly steps are the same as the hardware-rev2 steps
